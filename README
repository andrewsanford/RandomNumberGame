This is a school project I made for my Systems Programming class. It uses exclusively C.

DESCRIPTION:
Te game is to guess the number that the program randomly generates. By default, the number ranges form 1 to 10, but you can change the number in the program. When the user exits the program, it gives a summary of the user's win/loss ratio for that session.
